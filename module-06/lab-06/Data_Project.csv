The U.S. Department of Agriculture and state agriculture offices initiated a comprehensive barberry eradication program in the past to elimiate black stem rust. As a result, numerous populations of this species were destroyed (Weakley 1993, Wiegman 1993, Homoya 1992, Steyermark 1963).",Small Shrub.,21147,McCreary,LAKE CUMBERLAND,Whitley City,147,SOUTH CENTRAL REGION,1

Leaves are lance-elliptic to lance-ovate, 2 times longer than wide,  1-3 cm wide and often more than 4.5 cm in length. Flowers are white turning pink and fruiting stem (peduncle) erect.",This species occurs in  two somewhat distinct habitats in Kentucky which probably helps to delimit two varities (var. ozarkanum and another that has not formally been described).  The two habitat types are depression swamps and slopes of thin-canopied oak-hickory forests.,Some tree removal could be beneficial in maintaining the open character of these forests with careful implementation of the practice. Hand removal of trees in the vicinity of the population is recommended.  Exotic pest plants are a threat.

Leaves are 1.5-3.0 mm wide. As with other members of section Ovales some stems have flower/fruit clusters (spikes) at the apex of the stems (reproductive stems) and some stems lack these structures (vegetative stems). The vegetative stems are conspicuous and have numerous leaves on them. Reproductive stems are 35-100 cm tall and have 3-4 leaves on the lower part of the stems. At the apex of these stems are 3-7 stalkless somewhat round clusters of flowers/fruits (spikes). The spikes are widely spaced and the upper flowers in these spikes are female and the lower male.  The female flowers develop into fruits (perigynia) which are round and taper to a beak at their apices.

The edges of the petals are wavy but smooth.  A thin spur, 4-5 cm long, curves forward from behind the """"lip"""" petal.  The species has 2-3 large leaves with bases that loosely wrap around the lower portion of the stem.  These leaves are long and narrow (20 cm long, 3 cm wide) with a smooth edge.  The leaves higher up the stem are much smaller.  The fruit is ellipsoid, about 15 mm long and 3 mm wide.  Seeds are released when the fruit dries and its walls break open  (Shea 1992; Fernald 1970; Gleason and Cronquist 1991; Bailey 2001).","Occurrs on the Appalachian Plateaus of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama, the Coastal Plain of Alabama and Mississippi, the Blue Ridge Province of Georgia , North Carolina (Historic), and Tennessee; the Ridge and Valley Province in Alabama, and the Piedmont of Georgia and South Carolina.",The white fringeless orchid is a terrestrial orchid with white flowers clustered at the end of the flowering stem.
