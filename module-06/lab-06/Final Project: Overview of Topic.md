# Kentucky Rare Plant Database 

**Persona/Scenario**

The Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission (KSNPC) is pleased to announce an open proposal bidding for their Website Redesign and Development of their Kentucky Rare Plant Database. The Rare Plant Database provides information on rare plants across Kentucky, and it is utilized for different projects by private and public entities.  

The Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission will provide all the data necessary for the development of this project.

**1. Why are we making this product?**

	1. To assist in the redesigning of KSNPC's Kentucky Rare Plant Database webpage.
    2. To capture the distribution of Kentucky rare plant species monitored in an interactive web map.
	3. To display the information on one page and in a user-friendly manner. 
    
**2. What do we want to get out of this product?**

    1. Showcase the rare plants in Kentucky and to create a standard for the Natural Heritage programs in North America.
	2. Display the Rare Plant Database and their distribution by county.
    3. Change the static map format to an interactive map format.
    
**3. What do our users want to get out of this product?**

    1. Knowledge of extant/historic distribution of rare plants by county.
    2. Visualize with a better design distribution of plants by county.
	3. Provide stakeholders and citizens information with potential as a planning/education/conservation tool.

**4. Content Requirements:**
	
	1. Data will be represented on a basemap creating a choropleth map.
    2. Data will be encoded as a polygon colored or shaded according to species occurences, observed or historic/extirpated, represented for each county.
	3. A legend will inform user of specific information regarding the selected species for the choropleth map (common and scientific name, family, etc).  
	4. An info window might also be available with more information regarding species habitat, description, phenology, etc.
	
**5. Functional Requirements:**

	1. Map will load data dynamically from a CSV and JSON file.
	2. One data layer will be created with the distribution of species observed and historic/extirpated by county.
	3. Data layers will be drawn to map.
	4. Additional information will be attached to each county polygon on a click or hover.
    5. Upon a click on a protected area polygon the map will automatically zoom in at least one level.
    6. A search box will be added to the map.
    7. A toggle layer option will be added to the map.?
