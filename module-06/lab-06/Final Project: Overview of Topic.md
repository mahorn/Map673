# Kentucky Rare Plant Database 

**Scenario**

Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission is pleased to announce an open proposal bidding for their Website Redesign and Development of their Kentucky Rare Plant Database. The Rare Plant Database provides information on Endangered, Threatened and Species of Concern Plants monitored by KSNPC. 

Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission will provide the database for the project.

**1. Why are we making this product?**

	1. To redesign the KSNPC website and the Kentucky Rare Plant Database.
    2. To capture the distribution of Endangered, Threatened and Species of Concern Plants monitored by KSNPC 
       in an interactive web map.
	3. To make the information user-friendly. 
    
**2. What do we want to get out of this product?**

    1. Use it as a conservation tool.
	2. Display the Rare Plant Database and their distribution by county.
    3. Create a better user-friendly interactive map.
    
**3. What do our users want to get out of this product?**

    1. Knowledge of RPD distribution by county.
    2. Visualize with a better design distribution of plants by county.
	3. Operate this product as conservation/planning tool.

**4. Content Requirements:**
	
	1. Data will be represented on a basemap creating a choropleth map.
    2. Data will be encoded as a polygon colored or shaded proportionally to the value represented for each county by Species.
    3. Count by Species will be represented on a basemap creating a proportional symbol map.
	4. A legend will inform user of specific information regarding the selected species for the choropleth and proportional 
       symbols map (comun name, scientific name, family, etc).  
	5. An info legend will be available with species picture and more information available (habitat, description, phenology,
       etc). 
	
**5. Functional Requirements:**

	1. Map will load data dynamically from a CSV and JSON file.
	2. Two data layers will be created (distribution of species and count of each species by county).
	3. Data layers will be drawn to map.
	4. Additional information will be attached to each county, and to each protected area polygon on a click or hover.
    5. Upon a click on a protected area polygon the map will automatically zoom in at least one level.
    6. A search box will be added to the map.
